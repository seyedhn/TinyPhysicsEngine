# TinyPhysicsEngine

This is a small 2D physics engine I am working on as a hobby. I am using SFML to render the colliders. Currently the engine only deals with Circle & AABB collisions. The broadphase is multi-thread brute force.

**Next steps:**
1. Force-based collision responses.
2. Static and dynamic objects
3. Sleep and awake states
4. Linked list data structures
5. Grid-based spatial partitioning.
6. Octrees
7. Bounding Volume Hierarchies
8. BSP tree hierarchies
9. OBBs
10. Convex geometries
11. Multi-threaded broad & narrow phase
